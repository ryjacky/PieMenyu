# PieMenyu: Cross-Platform Radial Menu

## About
Originally the version 3 of AutoHotPie but is later renamed and separated into its own repository because AutoHotKey is no longer the backend in this version. Please also checkout @dumbeau for the [AutoHotPie](https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie) project.
**What's different?**
PieMenyu focuses on cross-platform and customizability. 
**What's the same?**
This project especially benefits users of creative software like design tools, video editors, and 3D modeling applications. Anyone struggling to manage numerous shortcuts and seeking a more intuitive way to trigger actions will find AHP and PieMenyu valuable.

**Main features:**
* **Cross-platform support (currently Windows, macOS and Linux coming soon).**
* **Customizable tasks - Each pie item slice can perform multiple tasks in PieMenyu.**

## Current Status:
PieMenyu's development is paused due to busy life. I'm looking to restart as soon as possible if time allows.
